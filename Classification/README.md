TODO:
#####

1. Attempt Option 1 as a Regression problem.
2. Implement Regularization to prevent overfitting (OP1, OP2)
3. Experiment with other feature extraction techniques or 
   image preprocessing (i.e scaling or crop faces)
3. Attempt Option 3
	a. Classification problem
	b. Check for available transfer learning models.
