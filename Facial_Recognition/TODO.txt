Prepare Docker container for deployment/assignment.
1. Research DL architectures fit for facial recognition.
2. Research common methods to speed up/maximize the efficiency of the task.
3. Implement model and train/test on LFW dataset.
4. Utilize face_recognition_models
	Need to decide between webcam demo or upload photo
5. Complete paper
OPTIONAL: Research GANS for generating training/testing data.


Decided approach:
Utilize facial_recognition module API to perform demo.
